Lawrencium Fun Facts!

- Lawrencium, a member of the rare earth metals, does not actually occur in the environment on Earth.
- It was discovered on February 14, 1961, by a team of researchers made up of - Albert Ghiorso, Almon Larsh, Robert Latimer, and Torbjorn Sikkeland.
- The team, working at UC Berkley, bombarded three milligrams of californium with boron ions to produce the result.
- The first experiment with this bombardment used nitrogen bombardment, which resulted in the target of californium being destroyed.
- The end result was a sample of lawrencium that was only two micrograms.
- A Russian team was able to synthesize lawrencium in 1965 by bombarding an isotope of americium with an isotope of oxygen.
- Despite uncertainties over the Berkley team's data, IUPAC declared the discovery to the 1961 team.
- The element's name was assigned by the researchers, but was not officially designated by the IUPAC until 1997.
- They chose to name the element after the inventor of the cyclotron, Ernest Lawrence.
- Lawrencium is a radioactive element, wholly synthesized from other elements.
- It is the last element found in the actinide series, and is also the heaviest.
- It is chemically similar to other actinides, and is homologous to lutetium.
- There are eleven isotopes of lawrencium, and one isomer.
- All of lawrencium's isotopes are radioactive, and the most stable of its isotopes is Lr-262.
- Lr-262 only has a half-life of 3.6 hours.
- Most of the lawrencium isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute.
- Despite its position on the periodic table which should make lawrencium a transition metal, it is actually an actinide.
